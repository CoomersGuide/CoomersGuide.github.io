Latest:
- (10/04) You can now toggle whether to use the newest AI for your model tier (Dragon, Griffin) available for your stories in Game Settings using the 'Newest AI Updates' toggle. It looks like an opt-in beta for the Universe solution they're testing.
- (29/03) Experimentation is underway by the developers regarding the injection of tags into the model's response processing, otherwise known as Universes. We've lovingly nicknamed it 'CYOAIDS' for its past effect on quality while they were testing. This tech is how the Lovecraft model will be brought back, albeit more cost-effective (and possibly weaker than it was). More: https://aidungeon.medium.com/ai-dungeon-universes-c73abe86cd1b
- (01/03) Help us bring the eloquent Lovecraft Model back by voting on it on the feature suggestions page! https://features.aidungeon.io/ideas/AID-I-1073
- (23/02) World Creation is now here, under Worlds -> My Worlds -> Create Worlds. It is best used as a springboard for WI, as it has inbuilt generation utilities for things like races and locations.
